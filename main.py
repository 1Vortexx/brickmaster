# ⚠️ Important Notice Regarding BrickMaster Source Code

Due to repeated cases of code theft and misuse, the BrickMaster project is no longer open-source.

Effective immediately as of this post:

* The BrickMaster source code will no longer be publicly available.
* The **only parties who retain access** are:

  * Discord Developer Compliance (for oversight purposes).
  * Verified BrickMaster Developers (official team only).

This decision was not made lightly. BrickMaster was originally released as open-source to encourage collaboration and learning, but unfortunately, individuals have exploited that trust by stealing and redistributing the code without authorization.

From this point forward:

* Compiled releases will still be published for community use.
* The source code will remain private** to protect the integrity of the project.

We appreciate the understanding of our community and legitimate users. BrickMaster will continue to evolve, but in a way that ensures its security and respect for the work of its developers.

— The BrickMaster Development Team
