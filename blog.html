  <h1>BrickMaster Open-Source Regulation Update</h1>
  <p>Over the past several months, the BrickMaster project has proudly operated as an open-source initiative. Our intention was to empower developers, encourage transparency, and allow the community to contribute to the future of BrickMaster.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we have experienced repeated instances of code theft. Individuals have taken advantage of the open-source model to strip features, rebrand BrickMaster, and present stolen work as their own. These actions undermine the integrity of our team and the trust we've built with our community.</p>
  <p>As a result, the BrickMaster Team has made the difficult decision to remove open-source compatibility moving forward. Effective immediately, the repository will no longer contain active source code updates. Only <b>Discord Developer Compliance</b> and official <b>BrickMaster developers</b> will retain direct access to the source code.</p>
  <p>This change ensures that the project continues to grow under a secure and trusted environment, while still allowing our community to benefit from BrickMaster as a tool. We will continue to publish updates, changelogs, and documentation, but the underlying source will no longer be freely available.</p>
  <p>We understand this decision may disappoint some contributors, but we believe this step is necessary to protect the long-term vision of BrickMaster. Our team remains committed to delivering innovative features, maintaining stability, and supporting roleplay communities worldwide.</p>
  <p>We thank everyone who has contributed to BrickMaster during its open-source phase. Your feedback and ideas have shaped the project into what it is today.</p>
